# scrapping_word_files
This tool scrapes data from specific sections of multiple word files and collates the data in an excel. 

This allowed me to review multiple word reports in one go. Also, 
1.	I can make sure that patent details are consistent in all sections of a report. 
2.	I can make sure that consistency is maintained across multiple reports.


Thus I was able to review multiple reports at a much faster rate. Also I was able to check if the master tracking sheet (an excel summary of analysis) was in line with the details filled in word reports
